# MCP
Model context protocol serves as a standardized interface that allows AI models to interact with various external resources. By providing a consistent protocol, MCP simplifies the process of connecting AI applications to diverse data sources and tools, reducing the need for custom integrations.

## MCP Components
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The core protocol that defines how AI models can access and interact with external resources.

- **Model Context Protocol Client**: A client library that implements the MCP, allowing developers to easily integrate AI models with external resources.

- **Model Context Protocol Server**: A server that hosts the MCP, providing a centralized point for AI models to access external resources.

## MCP Usage
1. **Install the MCP Client**: Use the provided client library to integrate MCP into your AI application.
2. **Configure the MCP Server**: Set up the MCP server to expose the necessary external resources.
3. **Connect AI Models**: Use the MCP client to connect your AI models to the MCP server, enabling them to access and interact with external resources. 

## MCP Example
```python
from mcp_client import MCPClient

client = MCPClient()
client.connect("http://mcp-server-url")
response = client.request("resource_name", {"param1": "value1"})
print(response)
```
To use MCP client, follow these steps:
1. Import the MCP client library in your application.
2. Create an instance of the MCP client.
3. Connect to the MCP server using the `connect` method.
4. Use the `request` method to access external resources.

## MCP Benefits
- **Standardization**: Provides a consistent interface for AI models to access external resources.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of external resources, making it easy to integrate with different systems.
- **Scalability**: Allows AI applications to scale by offloading resource access and management to the MCP server.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the process of integrating AI models with external resources, reducing development time and complexity.   

## MCP Documentation
For more detailed information on how to use MCP, MCP servers etc. refer to the [MCP documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).


## MCP Client Features
- **Resource Discovery**: Automatically discover available resources on the MCP server.
- **Request Handling**: Send requests to external resources and handle responses.       

- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
- **Logging**: Log requests and responses for debugging and monitoring purposes.        
- **Configuration Management**: Easily manage configuration settings for the MCP client.

### Common use cases:

- Connecting to databases to query and analyze data
- Accessing file systems to read and write documents
- Integrating with APIs for real-time information
- Connecting to development tools and workflows
